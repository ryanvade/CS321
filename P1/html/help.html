                How to design an invitation:
            </h2>
            <li>
                First choose a template from the selection after logging in.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Next on the design page feel free to upload images, implement text boxes, choose fonts, and sizing of
                lettering to make your invitation unique.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After you are done editing your invitation choose quantity, sizing of invitations, and fill out shipping
                information for your order.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
